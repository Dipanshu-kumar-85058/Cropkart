**Empowering Farmers, Connecting Communities**  
Hackathon Prototype (SIH 2025)

## 🚀 Overview
CropKart is a **digital marketplace** that connects **farmers directly with buyers** (consumers, retailers, wholesalers, restaurants), eliminating middlemen and ensuring **fair pricing**.

This prototype is a **frontend-only web app** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, powered by a fake JSON database (`crops.json`).

- ➕ **Post Crop Form** → Farmers can add new crops dynamically.
